Hi! We're Nani-Games! As you may have noticed, we are a little programming community. Our team members are students and pupils, who found fun in writing games. At this moment we are developing our homepage and our first game demo. For sneak peakes and updates follow us on twitter ( [@nanigames_](https://twitter.com/nanigames_) ) or on instagram ( [@officialnanigames](https://www.instagram.com/officialnanigames/) ).

## FAQ

### Again, but slowly... Who are you?

Nani-Games is a developer community. It was created in the year 2017, on the 9th of November. Originally, there were four "founders" but due a lack of time and motivation two "founders" had to leave the community. Today - 3 years later - the leaders are KoolerNolan and Ceytec and they both take care of everything related to "Nani" ( Nickname ). Nani runs many different services, such as game servers, bots and websites. But the main reason, why the community was created, is to make games. And they show off in many shapes and colors. The developers of Nani will make every game as unique as possible. They won't have any microtransacations, dlcs and they won't need any extra payment, like a monthly subscription. Many of them will be for free to download but the possibility of having "pay-once" prices on a few games in the future isn't excluded.

### W-w-what do you guys do? And how?

Nani is a place where members of the team can release games and present them to the whole world. The possibilities aren't limited and we don't focus on a specific programming language. The majority of our team members uses Unity and C# to make games but however we do have some ppeople who work with Unreal Engine and C++ or even GameMaker Studio 2. As we said before, Nani doesn't have limitations. So it's the developers decision how his/her game should look like. None of the members or leaders will interfere on that and they won't command you to use certain ideas or anything, as long the game isn't against certain rules and has a basic structure.
By basic structure we mean a constant/stable framework, the usage of original material and a working game. If your game doesn't work as planned, e.g. sequences don't load or anything like this, the game wouldn't be released until the issues have been fixed.
We're pretty considered about the games we release and won't present anything to players until it's done.
